## What is this?

This is the case for a luggable, all-in-one SFF PC, which is an homage to and inspired by the Compaq Portable line of computers ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_Portable_386)).
The design phase of the project took a couple of months as an exercise in learning FreeCAD. The internal structure of the case is inspired by the excellent Beam case ([BeamCase on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/826374-beamcase-sw-sff-sandwich-case-in-18-different-size)).
Aluminium beams are recommended but I used four 300mm 3D printed beams of PETG material.
The case is sandwiched with a 16" LCD monitor using a custom 3D-printed bracket. It also has a mouse hidden at the back, inside a little cabinet.

## Assembly

The case was originally printed using the BambuLab A1 printer with a 0.6mm hardened steel nozzle.
Note that the 1515 beam frame has been scaled up to 1616 because it was really fragile.

1. **Print all structural components** - use PETG for side panels and beams (1515 profiles) and PLA for cover panels.
2. **Assemble the 1515 beam frame** (printed with PETG) according to the CAD layout.
3. **Install motherboard, PSU, and drives** into the frame.  
4. **Attach 80mm intake and exhaust fans** to their respective positions.  
5. **Wire up all internal connections** for PSU, peripherals and display.  
6. **Connect angled HDMI and USB-C adapters** to the GPU and route to monitor.  
7. **Install the monitor bracket** and secure the 16" screen.   
8. **Attach all panels magnetically**, except for the bottom and rear which are mechanically fixed.  
9. **Mount the keyboard with magnetic latches** on the front.  
10. **Store the mouse and cable** in the rear compartment.
